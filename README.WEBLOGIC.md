Domain Name Resolution for WebLogic Applications:
When working with WebLogic applications like the VBMS P2 application, domain name resolution is critical for proper functionality. The application expects to be accessed via specific domain names (like claims01.p2.vbms.va.gov), and we need to ensure these domain names resolve to your local machine for development and testing purposes.
